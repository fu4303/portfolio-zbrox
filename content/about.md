Hi,

My name is Rostislav and I'm a software developer, currently living and working in Sweden. My interests are not eclectic, they're just sincerely random. And I'm always up to discover new ones.

Day to day, I mostly use Rust and Typescript to build things. And when the opportunity arises I make some iOS/macOS apps in Swift. I'm interested in UI/UX but recently have been involved predominantly in backend work.

On this blog, you'll find my scribbles mainly on technical stuff that hopefully might be useful for other people stumbling on the same issues. It is created with [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola), using a slight modification of the great [Hermit theme](https://github.com/VersBinarii/hermit_zola). You can find the source code [on my GitHub](https://github.com/zbrox/site).
